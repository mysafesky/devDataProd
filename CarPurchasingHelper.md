Core Sorting Function
========================================================

The core of this app is sorting, here is a example of sorting and only display first 2 rows. The result display is a little bit messy here because of the limit of width

```r
attach(mtcars)
RowsToShow <- 1
colInterest <- mpg
result<- head(mtcars[order(colInterest),], n = RowsToShow)
result
```

```
                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat   wt  qsec vs am gear carb
Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4   8  472 205 2.93 5.25 17.98  0  0    3    4
```
